At this point they came in sight of thirty forty windmills that there are on
plain and as soon as Don Quixote saw them he said to his squire Fortune is
[2]
arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our desires
ourselves for look there friend Sancho Panza pointed Don Quixote
where thirty or more monstrous giants present
[3]
themselves all of whome I mean to engage in battle and slay and with whose
spoils we shall begin to make our fortunes For this is righteous warfare
and it is
[4]
God's good service to sweep so evil a breed a breed from off the
face of the earth Don Quixote said valiantly
[5]
What giants said Sancho Panza
[6]
Those thou seest there answered his master with the long arms and some
have them nearly two leagues long
[7]
Look your worship said Sancho what we see there are not giants but windmills
and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by the wind make the
millstone go
[8]
It is easy to see replied Don Quixote that thou are not used to this business
of adventures Those are giants and if thou art afraid away with thee out of
this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage them in fierce and
unequal combat
[9]
So saying he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante heedless of the cries
his squire Sancho sent after him warning him that most certainly they were
windmills and not giants he was going to attack He however was so positive
[10]
that they were giants that he neither heard the cries of Sancho nor perceived
near as he was what they were but made at them shouting Fly not cowards
and vile beings for a single knight attacks you
[11]
A slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to move
seeing which Don Quixote exclaimed Though ye flourish more arms than the
giant Briareus ye have to reckon with me
[12]
So saying and commending himself with all his heart to his lady Dulcinea
imploring her to support him in such a peril with lance in rest and covered
by his buckler he charged at Rocinante's fullest gallop and fell upon the
[13]
first mill that stood in front of him but as he drove his lance-point into
the sail the wind whirled it around with such force that it shivered the
lance to pieces sweeping with it horse and rider
[14]
who went rolling over on the plain in a such a sorry condition Sancho hastened
to his assistance as fast as his ass could go
[15]
and when he came up found him unable to move with such a shock had Rocinante
fallen with him
