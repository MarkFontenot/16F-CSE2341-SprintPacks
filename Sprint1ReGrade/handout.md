# Sprint 1 Execution ReGrade

The portion of the grading rubric for Sprint 1 that was devoted to execution against test files is eligible for a “do-over”. Everyone is eligible to have updated code re-executed for grading against the test files.  However, you aren’t required to re-submit. 

You may make any changes to your sprint 1 code base necessary.  This includes using any updated versions of string and vector from Sprint 2. 

**Due Date:**  Monday October 17, 2016 @ 6am pushed to github under a new branch named **Sprint1ReGrade**.  Don't forget to issue the pull request.
